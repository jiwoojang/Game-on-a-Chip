# Game-on-a-Chip
A small dig-dug style game built to run on the Keil MCB 1700 demo board

This was a end of course project to learn more about real time operating systems. This game was built as an excavator style game were objectives, and penalties are hidden behind an image which players had to dig out using their movement. 

The game was rendered on the LED Display included on the Keil board. Player movement input was controlled by a 4 direciton joystick, and a potentiometer was used to increase or decrease the speed of the player. 

The more objectives taken with the least damage from penalties, the better the player score. 

*Note that all files includede in the HardwareFiles folder were provided by the manufacturer, or the school administration in order for teh board to operate on a low level. Files in the GameFiles folder were written by myself and my lab partner Rahul Mehta*
